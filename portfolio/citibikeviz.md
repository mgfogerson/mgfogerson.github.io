<h1 id="projecttitle">Citibike Tableau Story</h1>
<p id="projectp">This Tableau story seeks to break down and understand trends in the riders of Jersey City's Citibike program. It uses data collected from 2017-2020 to chart demographic changes, station usage and peak riding times from month down to hour. Several of the charts have sliders to adjust the measurement, such as comparing year-to-year gender breakdowns or most popular start times. A fullscreen button on the bottom right can provide a better view.</p>
