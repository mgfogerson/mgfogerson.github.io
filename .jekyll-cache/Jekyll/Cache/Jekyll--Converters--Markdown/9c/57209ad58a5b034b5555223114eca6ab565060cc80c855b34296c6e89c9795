I"B<p>Today, I'm finishing and pushing to live a whole slew of changes to my website, including this blog feature. I'm excited for the potential of this site to become more streamlined than it has been before, and to become a place that quickly communicates the skillsets I picked up with the University of Oregon's Data Analysis program. However, as soon as I began to dig around in the HTML and Jekyll formatting I'd built the site in, I realized just working on this, so far after I'd had any official HTML assignments, was going to be a milestone of its own. The same goes for my SQL, JavaScript and Python skills, which I've at least been honing on Codecademy in the interim. I'm hoping to have new blog posts weekly that chronicle new projects, show off my evolving skills, and act as milestones for me to look back on.<br />
