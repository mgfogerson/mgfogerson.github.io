<h1 id="projecttitle">Plotly Biodiversity Dashboard</h1>
<p id="projectp">This Plotly dashboard is written in Javascript and charts the individual results of a trial on the biodiversity of test subjects' bellybuttons. Bateria types are measured in operational taxonomic units, or OTU, which defines closely related groups of individuals. These charts populate with the 10 most common OTU families, charting their relative frequency on the bar and bubble charts. Their demographic information occupies the left panel, and the gauge tracks the number of times they washed their navel during the trial. This dashboard has style changes not found in the original repo.</p>
