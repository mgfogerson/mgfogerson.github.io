<p id="myintro">{{ "A motivated data, research and communications expert, 
    looking for opportunities to explore and analyze hidden trends from rich data sets. 
    My background in writing and Communications helps me to realize dry analyses as insightful stories to 
    engage readers and inform critical business decisions. My Data Analytics training helps me to apply a 
    wide variety of tools in the endeavor to break down data, collaborating with others over tools like Git 
    and Google Suite. I can retrieve, clean, parse and display data using a variety of software tools,
     such as Python scripting, Javascript apps and SQL schemas. My recent experience with the Data Analytics 
     Bootcamp gave me proficiency with these tools and more, and also prepared me to quickly learn and
      integrate new languages and software into my work. Data Analytics is a field I pursued hoping to break 
      down hidden trends and bring direct utility to my communications skills." }}</p>
